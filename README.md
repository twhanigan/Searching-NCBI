# Searching-NCBI
This program is useful to search the NCBI database and parse the data by using the XML parser element tree.
The initial data in the program is imported as a pandas dataframe file containing a column called "Entrez", which holds Entrez ID's for each gene of interest.  As an example, this program uses the Entrez ID's for a gene set to identify the chromosome where the each gene is encoded and plots a previously identified correlation between each gene and the activity of a small molecule inhibitor(in the original xlsx file "Final Table_2.xlsx" as column "Pearson") and plots this correlation by chromosome as a boxplot and violinplot.  This program uses the entrez module from biopython and is an adaptation of the code found here:https://biopython.org/wiki/Annotate_Entrez_Gene_IDs, but uses a more straighforward approch to parse the XML output from NCBI.  For an in depth look at the E.Fetch, E.Search, E.Read modules from NCBI, see https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK25499/
